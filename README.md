calculus
========

This is `calculus`. `calculus` is some kind of playground to combine techniques
and to implement various algorithms. There might be simpler solutions by using
available implementations, but this project is about doing it by yourself.

Basically, `calculus` is a library providing just functions for a simple calculator.

But there is a neat feature. You can mix various number systems.

Supported Number Systems
------------------------

* Decimal, e.g. `1`, `12`, `42`, `128`
* Binary, e.g. `b1`, `b1100`, `b101010`, `b10000000`
* Octal, e.g. `o1`, `o14`, `o52`, `o200`
* Hexadecimal, e.g. `x1`, `xC`, `x2A`, `x80`

For examples take a look at [test/calculus.c](../master/test/calculus.c).

Implemented Mathematical Operations
-----------------------------------

* Addition `+`
* Subtraction `-`
* Multiplication `*`
* Division `/`
* Exponentiation `**`
* Least Common Multiple `lcm()`
* Greatest Common Divisor `gcd()`
* Fibonacci Number `fib()`
